* Start to elaborate wires and registers. Have no-driver and multiple-driver bugs so far.
* Store the elaborated modules to the target work library and update the current_design if elaborate successfully.
* Fix the bug in reducing range expressions.
* Fix a bug in the deep_copy() of netlist::Port. As VIdentifier has range definitions inside, it needs to be deep_copied.
* Add a avs_shell command "report_netlist" to show the internals of a module or internal item.
* Show constant numbers in a range expression in the form of plain decimal number instead of fix-width number.
