* Add a function named multi_driver_checker() in variable to handle the multi-driver check. However, this is far from perfect. 
  Different range select in different always blocks will cause false alarm. This must be fixed. Which means the check should be 
  run after generation block are unfolded.
* Add set_always_pointer() member function to all NetComp classes. It is used to set the pointer to its father netlist::SeqBlock.
  Which will be used for multi-driver check.
* Able to add new modules to the elaboration list automatically.

##### Fri 08/06/2012
* Rewrite update_name() in Module to calculate_name(). Now it is a const function without any side effect in the module.

##### Thu 07/06/2012
* Fix the no-load problem.
* Fix the multiple driver problem, which is caused by uninitilised port directions in instances.
* Add update_ports() in Netlist::Instance to update the ports directions before db_register() in Netlist::Module::elaborate().
* Add find_port() in Netlist::Module.

##### Wed 06/06/2012
* Start to elaborate wires and registers. Have no-driver and multiple-driver bugs so far.
* Store the elaborated modules to the target work library and update the current_design if elaborate successfully.
* Fix the bug in reducing range expressions.
* Fix a bug in the deep_copy() of netlist::Port. As VIdentifier has range definitions inside, it needs to be deep_copied.
* Add a avs_shell command "report_netlist" to show the internals of a module or internal item.
* Show constant numbers in a range expression in the form of plain decimal number instead of fix-width number.
