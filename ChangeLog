* Fix a bug in the deep_copy() of netlist::Port. As VIdentifier has range definitions inside, it needs to be deep_copied.
* Add a avs_shell command "report_netlist" to show the internals of a module or internal item.
* Show constant numbers in a range expression in the form of plain decimal number instead of fix-width number.
