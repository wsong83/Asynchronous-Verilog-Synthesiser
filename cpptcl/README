You should see the following directories here:

- doc      - contains a short documentation for the library
             or see http://wsong83.github.com/cpptcl
- examples - some simple examples to show C++/Tcl basics
- test     - tests used for development - use them for regression testing
             if you want to modify the library
- details  - some additional code used by the library (not for client use)

In addition, the following files may be of interest to you:

- README   - this file
- LICENSE  - explanation of the license terms
- CHANGES  - the history of changes


The C++/Tcl itself consists of these files:
- cpptcl.h   - to be included in your own files
- cpptcl.cc  - to be compiled and linked with your code


In order to compile the tests and the examples you may need to change the
compiler options to fit your particular environment (different paths to the
Tcl headers and libs, another compiler, etc.)


Anyway - have fun! :-)
