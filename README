============================================
An Asynchronous Verilog Synthesis (AVS) System
============================================

This software is distributed under GPL v2.0 or later licenses.

This is an asynchronous synthesis software.
It reads in RTL-level Verilog HDLs and trys to partition the design into 
a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous (GALS) design while 
implement the asynchronous interface between synchronous islands.

What I have done:
* Provided a command line environment.
* Adopted a SystemVerilog preprocessor from the Verilog-Perl package to 
  handle macros.
* A Verilog parser which can read in synthesizable Verilog features.
* An error report system provide easy error type insertion and display.

What I need to do in the future:
* Extract static data-flow from the parsed design.
* Try to figure out how to partition the design.
* Petri-net based netlist optimization.

Package required:
  GNU Make              ( make       )
  GNU C++ Compiler      ( g++        )
  C++0x                 ( g++ -std=c++0x, lambda expression )
  Bison                 ( bison      )
  Flex                  ( flex       )
  GNU Boost Library     ( shared_ptr, regex, filesystem, program_options,
                          lexical_cast, format, string )
  GNU MP Bignum Library ( gmp, gmpxx )
  rlwrap                ( rlwrap     )

Install guide:
  make
