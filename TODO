* 13/06/2012   (**Important )   Process of reducing Case statement in Block, SeqBlock and GenBlock.
* 12/06/2012   (**Important )   Need serious test for Elab_empty and Elab_Const_If reduction in Block, SeqBlock and GenBlock.
* 11/06/2012   (**Normal    )   + and - for Numbers with x or z generate asserion failures as not supported yet.
* 11/06/2012   (**Normal    )   The != operator for netlist::Number generates wrong results when x or z exists. eg: "x1" != "0" results false.
* 09/06/2012   (**Important )   The multi-driver check is far complicated than I thought. The ranges/selectors should be considered into the check.
* 08/06/2012   (**Important )   Check all variables are properly expunged when not in use.
* 08/06/2012   (**Normal    )   May be there is no need to differentiate the types in ParaConn as they all go back to Netlist::Expression.
* 06/06/2012   (**Normal    )   May be there is no need to use IIdentifier. Just using BIdentifier for instance is fine.
* 05/06/2012   (**Important )   Set the pcomp member var for all VIdentifier and further reduce the netlist using ranges.
* 26/05/2012   (**Urgunt    )   Support elaborate command.
* 18/05/2012   (**Normal    )   The back_slash in cmd_lexer should be use for special char rather than complex name.
* 18/05/2012   (**Normal    )   The list in command line env can be embedded list like concatenations in Verilog, right now only one level of strings are supported.
* 17/05/2012   (**Important )   Need to rewrite the cmd_lexer class or use flex, not all Tcl features can be supported in current structure.

=============
* 03/06/2012   (Resolved    )   Change the type of const value in a range to netlist::Number rather than the mpz_class alient type. [05/06/2012 Done]
* 24/05/2012   (Resolved    )   Figure out why the synopsys translate on and off is not working in the verilog preprocessor and maybe fix it. 
                                [26/05/2012 Parameters of VPreProc must be set up before configuration.]
* 24/05/2012   (Resolved    )   Support casex in the verilog parser. [25/05/2012 Done]
* 23/05/2012   (Resolved    )   The hook function for macroDB is not good enough. Re-write it. [24/05/2012 Done, now it is called by set command and has the gEnv reference at hand.]
* 17/05/2012   (NoFixNeeded )   Support up and down button for history commands. (using getchar in a smart lexer I think) [21/05/2012 use rlwrap avs_shell instead of avs_shell itself.]
