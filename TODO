* 18/06/2012              (**Normal    )   Need serious test for the range array operations.
* 13/06/2012              (**Important )   Process of reducing Case statement in Block, SeqBlock and GenBlock.
* 12/06/2012              (**Important )   Need serious test for Elab_empty and Elab_Const_If reduction in Block, SeqBlock and GenBlock.
* 11/06/2012              (**Normal    )   + and - for Numbers with x or z generate asserion failures as not supported yet.
* 11/06/2012              (**Normal    )   The != operator for netlist::Number generates wrong results when x or z exists. eg: "x1" != "0" results false.
* 08/06/2012              (**Important )   Check all variables are properly expunged when not in use.
* 08/06/2012              (**Normal    )   May be there is no need to differentiate the types in ParaConn as they all go back to Netlist::Expression.
* 06/06/2012              (**Normal    )   May be there is no need to use IIdentifier. Just using BIdentifier for instance is fine.
* 05/06/2012              (**Important )   Set the pcomp member var for all VIdentifier and further reduce the netlist using ranges.
* 18/05/2012              (**Normal    )   The back_slash in cmd_lexer should be use for special char rather than complex name.
* 18/05/2012              (**Normal    )   The list in command line env can be embedded list like concatenations in Verilog, right now only one level of strings are supported.
* 17/05/2012              (**Important )   Need to rewrite the cmd_lexer class or use flex, not all Tcl features can be supported in current structure.

=============
* 26/05/2012 [25/06/2012] (Resolved    )   Support elaborate command. [at least run through the first time.]
* 09/06/2012 [25/06/2012] (Resolved    )   The multi-driver check is far complicated than I thought. The ranges/selectors should be considered into the check. 
                                           [now complicated and sort of thorough checks are performed on multi-driver, no-driver and no-load wires. Simple test passed. ]
* 20/06/2012 [25/06/2012] (NoFixNeeded )   Do I need range and select in identifier? May be one of them is enough? 
                                           [probably yes as it simplify the range check and it does not incur much memory overhead.]
* 03/06/2012 [05/06/2012] (Resolved    )   Change the type of const value in a range to netlist::Number rather than the mpz_class alient type. [Done]
* 24/05/2012 [25/05/2012] (Resolved    )   Figure out why the synopsys translate on and off is not working in the verilog preprocessor and maybe fix it. 
                                           [Parameters of VPreProc must be set up before configuration.]
* 24/05/2012 [25/05/2012] (Resolved    )   Support casex in the verilog parser. [Done]
* 23/05/2012 [24/05/2012] (Resolved    )   The hook function for macroDB is not good enough. Re-write it. [Done, now it is called by set command and has the gEnv reference at hand.]
* 17/05/2012 [21/05/2012] (NoFixNeeded )   Support up and down button for history commands. (using getchar in a smart lexer I think) [use rlwrap avs_shell instead of avs_shell itself.]
